# Clodonic Soft Launch Checklist

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Domain setup (clodonic.ai)
- [x] Core functionality (browse, vote, submit)
- [x] GitHub OAuth authentication
- [x] MCP server for Claude Code integration
- [x] Mobile responsive design
- [x] Security measures (DOMPurify, validation)
- [x] Rate limiting (30 patterns/hr, 10 votes/min)

## 📋 Pre-Launch Tasks

### 1. Seed Data (Ready to Deploy)
- [ ] Deploy `seed-data-launch.sql` with realistic vote counts (0-3 range)
- [ ] Verify all patterns render correctly
- [ ] Test pattern content for quality and usefulness

### 2. Homepage Stats Fix
- [ ] Ensure "Community Votes" shows real count from database
- [ ] Consider hiding stats until meaningful numbers exist
- [ ] OR add "Early Access" badge to set expectations

### 3. Final Testing
- [ ] Test voting as authenticated user
- [ ] Test OAuth flow end-to-end
- [ ] Submit a test pattern and verify it works
- [ ] Test MCP server integration (`claude mcp add https://mcp.clodonic.ai`)
- [ ] Verify mobile experience

### 4. Content Quality
- [ ] Review all 22 seed patterns for accuracy
- [ ] Ensure no typos or formatting issues
- [ ] Verify code examples are functional
- [ ] Check tags are appropriate

## 🚀 Launch Strategy

### Reddit Soft Launch Plan
1. **Target Subreddits**:
   - r/ClaudeAI (primary)
   - r/LocalLLaMA (if relevant)
   - r/programming (carefully, focus on Claude Code angle)

2. **Post Template**:
   ```
   Title: "Built a pattern repository for Claude Code best practices"
   
   Hey everyone! I've been using Claude Code extensively and noticed 
   we're all solving similar problems repeatedly. Built a simple site 
   to share patterns for CLAUDE.md files, agents, prompts, etc.
   
   It's seeded with some starter patterns, but the idea is for the 
   community to contribute what works for them.
   
   Features:
   - Browse patterns by type (CLAUDE.md, agents, prompts, hooks, commands)
   - MCP server for direct Claude Code integration
   - Vote on useful patterns
   - Submit your own (GitHub auth required)
   
   Would love feedback on what patterns you'd find useful!
   
   Site: https://clodonic.ai
   MCP: claude mcp add https://mcp.clodonic.ai
   ```

3. **Expectations**:
   - Be transparent it's newly launched
   - Emphasize community-driven aspect
   - Focus on solving real Claude Code pain points
   - Respond quickly to feedback

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Post-Launch (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor error logs: `wrangler tail`
- [ ] Check for spam/abuse
- [ ] Respond to Reddit comments
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs immediately
- [ ] Track user signups and pattern submissions

### Success Metrics
- User signups (target: 50 in first week)
- Pattern submissions (target: 10 community patterns)
- Votes cast (shows engagement)
- MCP installations (from server logs)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Acceptable for Launch
- Stats show real numbers (may be low initially) ✅ This is good!
- All patterns from "clodonic-system" ✅ Clearly a system account
- Limited initial content ✅ Expected for new site

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Criteria

**Ready to Launch When:**
1. Seed data deployed with realistic votes ✅
2. Core features tested and working ✅
3. No security vulnerabilities ✅
4. Mobile browsing functional ✅

**Not Required for Soft Launch:**
- Large pattern library (will grow organically)
- Perfect UI (can iterate based on feedback)
- High vote counts (will accumulate naturally)

## 📝 Quick Fixes Before Launch

```bash
# Deploy updated seed data
cd clodonic-api
wrangler d1 execute clodonic-db --remote --file=seed-data-launch.sql

# Verify deployment
wrangler tail

# Test the site
open https://clodonic.ai
```

## 🎯 Post-Launch Priorities
1. Respond to user feedback
2. Fix any reported bugs
3. Add requested pattern types
4. Improve search/filtering if needed
5. Consider adding pattern versioning
