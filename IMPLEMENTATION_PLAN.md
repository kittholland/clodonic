- [ ] Basic duplicate detection
- [ ] CORS and CSRF protection

### Day 6-7: Deploy & Test
- [ ] Deploy to clodonic.ai
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Load testing with sample patterns
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness check

## Phase 2: Authentication & Voting (Week 2)

### Day 8-9: Auth System
- [ ] Add email/password auth with JWT
- [ ] Add Google OAuth
- [ ] Add GitHub OAuth (most important for audience)
- [ ] Session management

### Day 10-11: Voting System

## Phase 3: MCP Integration (Week 3)

### Day 15-16: MCP Server
- [ ] Create MCP server on Workers
- [ ] Implement search endpoint
- [ ] Implement get endpoint
- [ ] Implement list endpoint

### Day 17-18: MCP Client Package
- [ ] Create npm package for MCP client
- [ ] Documentation for setup
- [ ] Test with Claude Desktop

### Day 19-21: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Seed with initial patterns from your analysis
- [ ] Write launch blog post
- [ ] Submit to HN, Reddit r/claudeai
- [ ] Monitor and fix issues

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Structure
```
/public
  /index.html         - Homepage
  /item.html         - Detail template
  /submit.html       - Submit form
  /style.css         - All styles
  /app.js            - Minimal interactions
```

### API Structure
```
/src
  /index.ts          - Main router
  /auth.ts           - Auth middleware
  /db.ts             - Database queries
  /validate.ts       - Input validation
  /ratelimit.ts      - Rate limiting
  /mcp.ts            - MCP server
```

### Database Tables (D1)
- users - Auth users
- items - Main content
- tags - Tag definitions
- item_tags - Junction table
- votes - Vote tracking
- rate_limits - Anti-spam

### Cloudflare Services
- Workers - API & MCP server
- Pages - Static frontend
- D1 - SQL database
- R2 - File storage (future)
- KV - Session storage (if needed)
- Durable Objects - Real-time features (future)

## MVP Feature Set

### Must Have for Launch
- ✅ Browse patterns by type
- ✅ Basic search
- ✅ Anonymous upload
- ✅ View pattern details
- ✅ Copy to clipboard
- [ ] Basic voting (no auth required initially?)
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Mobile responsive

### Can Wait
- Authentication (can launch anonymous-only)
- User profiles
- Edit/delete submissions
- Advanced search filters
- MCP integration
- API access

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **R2 not enabled**: Can store files in D1 as base64 initially
- **Rate limiting bypass**: Cloudflare WAF rules as backup
- **Database scaling**: D1 can handle millions of rows
- **DDoS**: Cloudflare handles automatically

### Community Risks
- **Spam**: Start with manual approval queue
- **Low quality**: Community voting will surface good content
- **Trolling**: Shadow ban system ready to implement
- **Legal issues**: Clear TOS, DMCA process

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- Site live and functional
- 10+ test patterns uploaded
- < 100ms response times
- Zero crashes

### Week 2  
- 50+ real patterns
- 100+ unique visitors
- Basic auth working
- Voting functional

### Month 1
- 200+ patterns
- 1000+ unique visitors
- Mentioned in Claude communities
- MCP integration working

## Development Workflow

1. Local development with Wrangler
2. Test with local D1 database
3. Push to GitHub
4. Auto-deploy to Cloudflare
5. Monitor with Cloudflare Analytics

## Go/No-Go Criteria for Launch

### Must Have
- [ ] Can browse patterns
- [ ] Can view details
- [ ] Can submit anonymously
- [ ] Basic anti-spam working
- [ ] Mobile works

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Voting works
- [ ] Search works well
- [ ] Auth system ready
- [ ] MCP documented

If must-haves are met, launch and iterate!
